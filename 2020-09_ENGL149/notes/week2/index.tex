\chapter{Week 2}

\section{9/21 -- Hour 5}

\subsection{Writing Prompt}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Primary: HR person or whoever decides you get interviewed. Secondary: your potential future coworkers (engineering department), whoever interviews you
    \item To filter out applicants in the first stage
    \item Software scanning. The HR person is in a work from home environment. Possibly more or less formal depending on industry, consider word choice. Geographic context.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Project 1}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a spreadsheet for tracking job applicants
    \item NOTE: ask professor if we could review my website
    \item Tailor resume for each job -- software intern is probably uniform enough
    \item Look at cal poly guide
    \item Look into the resume brainstorm. Work: \#hours/week, quantitative stuff. Projects: look at CPE 133/233? 
    \item Leadership? Do I even have any? Ask professor about somewhat radical activism.
    \item Place IEEE, SWE on the list. Also general ham radio on website (FCC part 97).
    \item Hobbies and interests? Cooking, erhu, 3D printing
    \item Qualitative aspects. Likely not on resume, but to keep in mind.
    \item Discouraged objective line
    \item Education: cal poly. Maybe include community college during HS
    \item Experience: Ask professor about quotes. ``Software engineer @ Apple'' instead of ``Apple -- Software engineer.'' Quantifiable metrics.
    \item Projects: astrid.tech and collision zone?
    \item Extra categories: use software skills
\end{itemize}
